<blockquote>
  <p>At heart we underestimate ourselves. We do not really believe in ourselves and remain for that reason weak, ineffectual, even impotent, when we could be strong, dominant, victorious.</p>
  
  <p>DR NORMAN VINCENT PEALE</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you want to be a successful negotiator. That is a very good starting point. It is a lot better than wanting to be a failure.</p>

<p>But how good you actually are at negotiating depends on a little bit more than a “want”. In this book I will show you many techniques of persuasion and “value creation”. But how good you actually become as a negotiator depends on one important factor more than anything else. And it is one factor that most similar books ignore: your aspiration.</p>

<p>First ... Who am I?</p>

<p>My name is Bob Etherington and I am a salesman.</p>

<p>I know that is similar to the introduction given by people in an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting but, judging by results, I am an experienced and successful communicator, business persuader and sales manager. It has taken me over 37 years in the “school of hard knocks” to get there but I’ve made it. (Hurrah!) For the record I am also a pilot, an engineer and a business owner, but selling activities still take up most of my business day.</p>

<p>So I’m about to save you 37 years of toil by condensing a big chunk of that knowledge into about 37,000 words in the little book you are now holding. I am not better than you, but I have learnt a lot about persuasion in business and that’s what you’ll find in this book.</p>

<p>Even though many business people are not very keen on either selling things or negotiating deals, it is a fact that for just about all commercial enterprises, there is nothing more important than those two activities. Why? Because without them nothing else happens.</p>

<p>Now, when you’re learning to sell, (I was initially trained by Rank Xerox in the UK c.1970) one of the required classes usually covers how to make initial contact with prospective customers. One method I was taught was how to write effective, door-opening, sales letters. “Lesson 1” on this subject included some explanation of the way most intended recipients tend to read sales letters.</p>

<p>You see, once your prospective customers have been enticed to open the envelope (getting them to do that is an art and science all on its own) they tend to do something unexpected. They look at the end of the letter first.</p>

<p>That is why most effective sales letters always have a “P.S.” at the end. And the strongest sales message in the letter is always contained in that “P.S.”. But as this is a book about negotiating and not a letter, it has a P.S. (Pre Script) at the beginning and a P.S. (Post Script) at the end and they are both the same. Because my most important message for you (a negotiating virgin) is contained in those P.S.s and it is key to your success as a top negotiator.</p>

<p>Here it is:</p>

<p><strong>P.S. Never enter into a negotiation unless you aspire to emerge from it with the very best possible deal you can imagine.</strong></p>

<p>As with so many areas of life, research and academic observation proves, over and over again, that successfully negotiated outcomes usually have little to do with either training, knowledge or experience. They DO always have a lot to do with your Attitude and Aspiration.</p>

<p>I have attended and conducted many negotiating training programmes around the world in the past few years. Delegates are often able to pass various assessment tests at the end of their programmes. They know, off-by-heart, the supposed formulae for conducting a perfect technical negotiation. They play the business-games and simulated negotiation exercises perfectly. Yet put them in the field in a real negotiation involving real assets, real products, real services and very real money and they fail to win the deals they could have won for themselves or their businesses.</p>

<p>I have been introduced to people who are supposed to be their company’s “top negotiator” with several years experience. They have invited me to observe them in action and give feedback. [What people usually want in these cases is the positive feedback ... in other words the good stuff only to bolster their fragile egos. Nothing at all, despite the initial brief, is really required from me, as their consultant, on the not-so-good side.] I have then sat at the back and watched the action. What happens is that this expert often conducts it technically, in a reasonably average manner. Indeed, he (or she) often gets a deal agreed, as if a “deal-at-any-cost” was the original objective. Yet the other side, often younger and hence by default with less experience, but with greater hunger and aspiration, gets easily the best cut of the negotiation.</p>

<p>On one occasion I was asked to watch, listen and observe one of these top “experienced negotiators” negotiate for my edification. (He was actually my boss at the time). He finally became so frustrated with his lack of progress and yet determined to impress (me?) that he eventually uttered the immortal words to the leader of the other team, “Is there any other financial incentive I can offer you to get you to give us the deal today?” The other side’s eyes spun like the reels in a fruit machine. I’m surprised their leader didn’t mime a cash register and say, “Cha-Ching!”</p>

<p>How much or how badly you desire and aspire to achieve the best negotiated outcome, compared with the same desire and aspiration on the other side of the table, is key to leaving the negotiating table with the best deal for you.</p>

<p>It isn’t a case of reaching a “great deal” at the expense of the other side. It is simply realizing your own value and thinking and acting in a manner that conveys this sense of purpose and confidence to the people sitting across the table from you. It is even possible to extend this idea to a team of people who are negotiating on your behalf by confidently setting an expectation of a great result.</p>

<p>In some of the in-house negotiation training programmes that I run for companies, we actually prove the validity of this high expectation/aspiration approach by being a little underhand with one of our training exercises.</p>

<p>We set up the delegates in two almost identical parallel negotiation exercises in separate rooms. The asset they negotiate over has no tangible value either to the buyer or the seller ... it is all in their perception.</p>

<p>The buying side in both negotiation groups has an identical briefing sheet. The sellers, on the other hand, are each set different objectives. One “selling” team is set an objective to get £50,000 for the asset. The other “selling” team just £20,000. What happens, every time we set the exercise, is that the team we settle the higher expectation on initially ends up negotiating a much higher final price for their asset. The amazing thing is that the buyers don’t feel hard done by and the sellers don’t feel imposed on either. The teams are generally shocked at the large difference between the outcomes and the reason for it, when this is revealed to them at the end.</p>

<p>If we set ourselves high standards and goals and truly aspire and expect to reach them it is amazing what we can achieve. In his book The Luck Factor (an academic examination of the repeatable behaviours of lucky people) Professor Richard Wiseman of the University of Hertfordshire, UK has found that one of the four key behaviours of lucky people is that they expect to be lucky. So prior to negotiating, a key behaviour for you virgin negotiators to work on is your level of aspiration and expectation.</p>

<p>This isn’t always easy ... as the 19th century American philosopher Henry David Thoreau said: “Most men live lives of quiet desperation and go to the grave with the song still in them”, and it seems to me, despite the mountains of positive-thinking self-help books which are available, not much has changed in the 21st century. (Are we really hardwired to feel so inferior to each other?)</p>

<p>Just a few years ago an anonymous survey taken in the First Class section of a major airline revealed that 76% of people seated up there “in-the-nose” believed that they did not deserve to be there! They thought that sooner or later someone would discover that they were not worthy. That their value was much less than they had been leading other people to believe.</p>

<p>Yet most people I meet have the potential to become anything they want to become.</p>

<p>In a previous book (Presentation Skills for Quivering Wrecks) I said that in my experience most business people around the world seem to be playing a cassette-tape/CD in their heads which isn’t helping them at all. The message that’s playing over and over again is: “What will they do when they discover I’m only me?”</p>

<p>Virgin Negotiators! ... if this is you it must stop. Today. Stop listening to that tape.</p>

<p>Our aspirations as human beings are very much dictated by our own self esteem. And our self esteem comes mainly from the constant conversations going on in our head.</p>

<p>I am actually typing this part of the book, in August 2007, seated upstairs on a 747 “Jumbo” on my way back to London from leading an in-house negotiation workshop for a company in Asia. [Thinks: “I see from the moving map display on the seat-back TV in front of me that we are currently flying just north of Istanbul ... there are some great natural carpet negotiators just below me.”]</p>

<p>Anyway, on the particular Asian training programme I have just delivered, there was a very able delegate – an Australian – who proved that he is, potentially, a very good technical negotiator. The problem has been, all week, that he has showed little belief in himself. He has constantly prefaced every exercise with an excuse:</p>

<p>“No but ... I just want to warn you I’ll be no good at this.” (He was great.)</p>

<p>“No but ... I’m actually a ‘techie’ I haven’t got the experience in the sales area.” (He was fine.)</p>

<p>“No but ... our product IS far too expensive.” (No it isn’t.)</p>

<p>“No but ... in the real world we have to give our customers a discount ... they demand it.” (I’m sure they do. Price is always an objection – but you’re not going to give them one.)</p>

<p>When it came to personal aspiration the Australian was shooting himself in the foot at every turn. If he continues like this he will continue to give away value to counterparties, which they would otherwise be quite willing to pay for.</p>

<p>By changing his in-head conversation first he will very rapidly – surprisingly rapidly – alter his perception of himself and subsequently other people’s perception of him.</p>

<p>As a starter I suggested swapping the “No but ...” (which he usually begins every sentence with) for “Yes and ...” thus removing all the negative parts of the following sentence. If he concentrates on this, I estimate other people will see the change in him in about two weeks.</p>

<p>When my business partner and I first set up our training business, on the dining table in my London apartment a few years ago, we never once told a lie about our size or the startup nature of our business. It simply never arose as a question from any potential customer and as they didn’t ask, we didn’t say anything. They told us the types of problem they wanted solved ... we told them how we could help and they, more often than not, engaged us. Sometimes before they knew our fee. We always thought and acted as if we were part of a huge organization which, until we set up on our own, is exactly the type of organization we had been working in.</p>

<p>Our aspiration level was high. We offered and delivered a high level of service so there were no complaints. We even appointed an external chairman for our company who would set a constant expectation of high performance and sales targets if we should ever falter in our resolve. Our strategy worked so well that we started to gain some really large international clients. After a few assignments our main contact from one particular large client bumped into me one day at London Heathrow airport.</p>

<p>“Hi Bob,” he said. “I was in your street, at that tennis shop, earlier today. Your offices are near there aren’t they? I didn’t see your office block. Where is it?” (Office block? ... Office block? It was the two of us with one phone and one (borrowed) laptop at my dining room table!)</p>

<p>But our aspiration levels were high as were our expectations. When negotiating deals for ourselves we never once gave in to the discount pressure ... we didn’t have to. We always appeared to be busy ... we kept ourselves “scarce”. We held our nerve when we were up against competitors even when our diary was empty! We “walked away” from the negotiating table a number of times whenever our fees were under pressure. It was odd how often on those occasions the assignments and the money chased us ... about 80% of the time as it happens. A typical illustration of this is shown in a client’s email copied word for word below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dear Bob</p>
  
  <p>Thank you for a series of interesting discussions over the past two months with respect to our proposed sales and marketing programme. We have just completed our monthly board meeting during which we considered your proposal in parallel with those from your competitors. I have to tell you that your fees are very high by comparison and this was the view of the whole board. Nevertheless we accept your proposal at the rates quoted and request that you let us know as soon as possible when you can start the work.</p>
  
  <p>John</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So can any of us tap into some psychological tools which will increase our individual self esteem, expectation and aspiration to a level which will bring us up to “top-negotiator” standard? Yes ... and the answer is instantly to hand: modern sports-psychology ... the world of techniques to which footballer David Beckham, golfer Tiger Woods, the whole of the 2006/7 Australian Cricket team (and just about all successful sports stars) attribute their long standing and continuing success.</p>

<p>You see most top sports stars are only human. They are not looking for success in a bottle of the ubiquitously named “banned-substance”. They know they have to find it in themselves. They suffer from all the self doubt and lack of self belief that you do. I know you never admit it and that with your friends and family, just like those sports stars (and the First Class passengers in that Boeing 747), you talk a good public talk. But left to their own devices, most people’s self-talk chatter is putting them down instead of up.</p>

<p>One of the most often faced challenges experienced by sports stars is how to improve their performance. They are frustrated that they know they often possess superior, physical attributes and strengths compared with their competitors (probably just like you and the things you would like to negotiate with a counterparty) and yet they’re consistently being out performed by their competition (like you are probably being out-negotiated by the team on the other side of the table).</p>

<p>In so many of these sports cases the one thing that separates their final performance from that of the others in the race has been found to be based in their belief as to their ability to outperform the competition. Simply put they are operating with a limiting belief as to their strengths and abilities compared with those on the other side. However research shows that an individual’s core beliefs in any given area of their life will ultimately determine the reality they draw into their life! ... Top performer, Poor performer or Average performer.</p>

<p>So how do you go about changing a limiting belief to a positive one – one that will result in a transformation of your expectations and aspirations? One that will bring about your transformation from an average negotiator to a top negotiator?</p>

<p>First, can I ask you ... do you talk to yourself? (Do I? ... I don’t know? Let me see now ...) You see it has long been established by psychologists and neuroscientists that we all (every person in the world) carry on a continuous dialogue, or self-talk, of something between 150 and 300 words each minute. This means that we process between 45,000 and 50,000 thoughts each day. Most of this dialogue is harmless and serves our daily activities such as, “I need to stop at the supermarket”. The problem comes about when your inner dialogue takes on a negative connotation like, “I’ll have to give them a discount ... they are in a much stronger position than us”. “We are only a start-up in this market. We don’t have the experience to compete at this level.” Or, “There are so many companies similar to us. We don’t stand a chance of getting it.” The constant negative reinforcement created by our habitual negative self-talk results directly in the creation of a limiting belief (or beliefs) that go on to become self-fulfilling prophecies.</p>

<p>A belief – positive or negative – is a feeling of certainty. Beliefs are, literally, hard-wired into our brain in comfortable grooves or neural motorways. Incoming data from your senses travel on these neural motorways on the way to interpretation in the brain. Therefore, if you sincerely want to change an unresourceful/limiting belief into a totally empowering belief, you must divert the negative neural motorway created in your brain.</p>

<p>You can achieve this in exactly the same way that the roadways were laid down in the first place: by using self-talk, or what are generally called “affirmations”. Affirmations are statements of fact or belief (negative or positive) that will ultimately lead to the end result you expect. Words that follow the phrase, “I am”, such as “I am a great negotiator” or “I am confident in the value of my service” are an affirmation. The simplicity of affirmations often makes more cynical people dismiss them. But ask any successful person for an opinion (and I often do) and you will hear no cynicism. Affirmations are regularly used by successful business people and professional athletes.</p>

<p>This is how you can compose effective affirmations for yourself. The process is a simple one. First, identify the areas of your life which are not working to your satisfaction ... in your case the area of successful negotiation. Now, write out your aspirational affirmations that represent things the way you want them to be. These will be the vehicles for creating new resourceful/positive motorways. Your affirmation should be short and to the point. It must be so simple that a small child will understand it. And because your brain cannot hold a negative thought it must always be stated in the positive. “I am a truly confident negotiator” not “I am not worried about negotiating.” Also, your affirmation must be stated in the present tense – as if it has already happened, for example, “I am a strong successful negotiator”.</p>

<p>Now you are going to use these affirmations to play a trick on your brain and to alter your perception of yourself and the world.</p>

<p>You think your perception (the way you see things) is reality and that it can’t be changed? I’m afraid you’re wrong and I am about to prove it. Before you go any further let me prove to you that your brain plays tricks on you all the time. With these aspirations you will just start getting your own back. Below is a chessboard. Two of the squares are marked respectively “A” and “B”. Here’s the question: which is the darker square “A” or “B”?</p>

<p><img src="http://web.mit.edu/persci/people/adelson/images/checkershadow/checkershadow_illusion4med.jpg" alt="Image" title="Image" /></p>

<p>Reality? Out there ... or ... just in your head?</p>

<p>Take your time ... it’s easy isn’t it? Of course square “A” is darker ... of course it is ... any fool can see that! But what if I were to tell you something. What if I were to tell you that they are both identical shades of grey! What if I were to tell you they are EXACTLY the same colour! Look again ... OK, now you think I’m totally crazy! But they are the same. It is just that your eye, seeing a three dimensional picture, tells your brain that things towards the background get darker and things in the foreground are lighter so that is what you perceive ... it just isn’t reality. This illusion was compiled by the psychologist Edward H. Adelson at MIT in Boston and to check that we are both not “bonkers”, go to his website: <a href="http://web.mit.edu/persci/ people/adelson/checkershadow_illusion.html">http://web.mit.edu/persci/ people/adelson/checkershadow_illusion.html</a> where you can check and prove it for yourself. (And yes ... as you will see, just like the squares above, they are exactly the same shade of grey.)</p>

<p>So now you are going start presenting different images and self-talk to your brain in order to change its perception of reality in exactly the same way. You are going to change your perception of reality until, like the chessboard squares, it becomes your reality!</p>

<p>So are you ready to apply this science? (Remember this technique is effective in all areas of human performance ... not just aspirational negotiation.)</p>

<ul>
<li>Sit upright on your bed or in a comfortable chair.</li>
<li>Shut your eyes and take two minutes or so to relax progressively from toes to head.</li>
<li>Imagine you are at the top of a 100-step staircase and mentally find yourself walking down, counting off the steps as you go. 100 ... 99 ... 98 ... 97 ... at each step feel yourself becoming more and more relaxed.</li>
<li>At the bottom of the imaginary staircase speak your affirmation aloud between five to twenty times. (This depends on the time you have and the number of beliefs you are reprogramming.)</li>
<li>When you have completed this exercise bring yourself out of your relaxed state, slowly from toes to head, and open your eyes.</li>
<li>Repeat this every day for just 30 days and see the difference in yourself.</li>
<li>Remember all you have to do is “do it”. The change will start in your brain long before you are conscious of the change.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why do you have to “say” the affirmation out loud? By speaking your affirmation aloud you are involving more of your brain by including two more of your senses: hearing and feeling. You must trust this process. You must give your affirmations a chance to achieve your desired outcome. If you worry or doubt yourself or wonder if your affirmations are working, you will convey this worry to your subconscious mind. And in doing that you will generate the belief that your desire may not come to pass or the affirmation may not succeed. This process works for everyone who does it. Just do it.</p>

<p>It is your beliefs that produce your life experiences, not the other way around. Organize and control your beliefs using affirmations to create a life filled with successful experiences. These experiences will reinforce the beliefs that created them. The business world is not necessarily led by the best people. It is always led by the people who think they’re the best.</p>

<p>All the available research shows that when experience and training are pitted against high aspiration and high expectation those aspirational negotiators tend to come out on top more often.</p>

<p>It is that simple.</p>
